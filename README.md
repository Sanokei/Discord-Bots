# Discord-Bots

**Discord Preist.py Bot**
A bot that makes what you DM it and sends it to a central server and notes it as "Anonymous"
You talk to to the bot via DM and it spits out what you said to a set server.

**Random Responding Bot.py**
A bot that takes something from a file and spits it out on a central server.
You set a prase it listens for and it if it is said then it spits out a random line from the file.

**Bet Bot**
Unfinished Idea I had for a gambling bot for discord servers. It didnt work so it has no documentation.
